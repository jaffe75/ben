#Custom theme for Ben Lobaugh
- changed html and css to clean up
- maintained custom functionality built by Ben
- Slider working - automatically adds images to links, however, they are set and not dynamically created

Will need to remove the Lipsum but all functionality that is overlaped by dummy text is still in place including your name and title
